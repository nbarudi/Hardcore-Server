Burner Drill + Core Sample?
	-> Machine to generate ores without mining. 
	-> Costs Mystical Fuel to run
	-> Requires a drill head maybe? Inventory might be a little difficult for this one
		-> Could also just pre-select 1 or 2 types of ores in each scanned chunk that can be mined using the drill!
		-> Instead of making a full tier system for mining drills?
		-> Would become something closer to the Void Ore Miner then a Quarry
	
Custom Dimension:
	-> Maybe using the Aether portal design?
	-> I dont know what is worth putting inside of this dimension
	-> Maybe custom mobs with special drops?
	-> Use mob names to re-texture them based on where they are
	-> Might be more of a full release update style of thing!
	
	I think this is a bust currently because I do not understand noise and world generation

Player Shops:
	-> Creating a vending machine block that players can sell items with?
	-> Maybe making use of normal player sign features?
	-> Or using Text Displays instead of item displays?
	-> Also possible to create an inventory for it if wanted?
	-> Unsure of How I would handle this one yet? also how I would handle economy
		-> I would prob make it a trade system? and not a monetary economy
		-> mainly because I do not want to implement a monetary economy 

Magic Watch: -> Item Model Made Just Need To Implement
	-> A watch the player can craft which can speed up or reverse time!
	-> Might be a little too annoying for new players so I will prob make it cost fuel to use.
	

Story:
	-> I do intend to have some type of story.
	-> Maybe once I plan on building the dimension I will have special story inside of it.
	-> Something along the lines of "The Traveler" moving on to a new dimension?
	-> Might be possible to retexture blocks based on the dimension it is in?
	
	
The Homewrecker:
	- Item at the request of Fab:
	- Cut off  your head! Requires no fuel! Gain your head.. thats all.
	- Cut off another players head! Costs 32 Mystical Fuel.
	- Losing their head obviously kills the player
	- No items will be lost for losing their head!
	
The Fabricator:
	- Support item that uses fuel to heal the player it hits!
	- Heals 0.5 hearts per hit. Will not use fuel if you miss!
	- In the spesific use of Vinny. It can instantly kill Fab.
	- This was their custom item.. so I will make it happen!

Design method Travler Spawns.. Unsure what I will do yet!


Playtest Notes (27/10/2023 -> There is a lot to change!):
- After purchasing double jump I could not double jump!
- Double jump is very janky
- Spectral Shears might be worth making a bit easier to create
- I think I need to do a lot of recipe balance!
	- Might make a document with all item recipes and their results to see what is too much
	- I dont want these items to become worthless due to cost to value issues
	- Since if you cant obtain the item until late game and its pointless then no point in making the item!
Big Issue: Travelers Book causes a LARGE lag spike when generating in ship chest!


Need to find a use for the "Golems Thoughts" item obtained from beating the Iron Golem Boss!
Not sure what item will fit well here yet but I will think of something!
Most likely going to be used for summoning The Traveler boss!
